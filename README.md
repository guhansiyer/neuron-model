# neuron-model

> Biological neural network depicted through a cellular automaton.

This cellular automaton models the development of multipolar neurons; those capable of forming multiple synaptic connections, in the nervous system. It simulates the maturation of neurons and ultimately constructs a neural circuit. After neurogenesis, neurons rarely degenerate or die under normal circumstances. In place of depicting conditions that may kill a neuron, this model instead demonstrates the varying strength of synaptic connections in a neural circuit.
